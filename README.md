# Epidemic-Analysis
This is my first project on the path of starting my career in data. This project analyses a simple dataset csv provided by [WHO](https://covid19.who.int/data). I chose to use the pandas dataframe to manipulate and analyze the data. Though it isn't much, I cover the big picture of Covid-19 in it's entirety from the very beginning of 2020 (when the data began to be collected), to 5/27/2022 (when the dataset was pulled from WHO). I appreciate anyone taking the time to look over my work and am open to any criticism/feedback.
